#### 1. Find the Data

All files are saved under [CSV](CSV/) directory. 

#### 2. Format and Test the Data

Excel were used to exam the data to help finding the right column and values to use.

Then a Jupyter Notebook was created to extract and merge all data into a single CSV file., which is self-documented:

[data_prep.ipynb](data_prep.ipynb)

Running the notebook creates the data file needed for next step at:

[Skeleton/assets/csv/ACS_vs_BRFSS_2014.csv](Skeleton/assets/csv/ACS_vs_BRFSS_2014.csv)

#### 3. Visualize the Data

- Most logic is in [Skeleton\assets\js\app.js](Skeleton\assets\js\app.js]).  
- Shared and static appreance control in [Skeleton\assets\css\d3Style.css](Skeleton\assets\css/d2Style.css)
